Mech Statement:
Add a feature to your RC robot that enables you to roll a ball up an inclined
plane at an angle of 35 degrees while attempting to avoid the ball rolling
sideways. There are three marks on the plane, each spaced 15 cm apart, and
the width of each successive section of the incline decreases by 5 cm. You
will score 10 points for passing the first mark, 30 points for passing the
second, and 70 points for passing the final mark.

Keep in mind that you won't receive any points for rolling the ball over without
passing any checkpoints, and that each checkpoint adds the aforementioned
score separately.


Our Solution:
Due to our Bot's modularity, two cardboard pieces are attached at the front on both sides using metal pieces from Mechanix kit using nut and bolt
This ensures that the ball doesnt roll sideways while climbing
here the front side is the flat side of metal white chassis
the bot had enough height so that the ball couldnt topple over it while climbing
Due to less rpm and more torque of the motors the bot can easily climb the incline and is easily controllable
