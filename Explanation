For the MRT electrical statement, we use the same sensor as that of AUV electrical statements. The difference is only in code.
In the code for this statement, along with the detection of distance and all the functionality of the AUV electrical code,
an additional condition checks if the distance is below a certain threshold (<8cm in this case).

The bot performs a series of commands if the distance ever falls below the threshold.
First, it stops. After a delay, it indicates using its buzzer+led that an obstacle was detected. 
Next, it starts to reverse and move away from the obstacle for a set amount of time, overwriting any controller commands supplied by the user. 
Once the reversing period is over, control is handed back to the user, and regular operations can proceed.
