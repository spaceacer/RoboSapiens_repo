Elec Statement:
Include a feature in your bot that can recognize collisions
on the front face of the bot, which should be demonstrated
via physical signal, such as a buzzer beep or led
illumination. You can determine the detecting range,
however it shouldn't be greater than 5 cm. Any detection
made over a 5 cm distance will not be rewarded. Perfect
collision detection is also anticipated and will follow you
five times as far as simple detection. The setup will be
static (i.e. asking you to bring your bot towards the
obstacle in steps) and markings will be present near the
obstacle for measuring distances. Depending on the
solution, more creative solutions will earn you more points. 

Solution:
Sensor module was mounted on the front side of our bot using screws.
The module contained two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors fitted side-by-side facing forwards, mounted on a fret board
this gives us a wider field of view and help in the detection and avoidance of thin object placed in front of bot

A radically new solution for sensor module
