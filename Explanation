The bot was given an obstacle course that it needed to navigate in order to win

What makes our Bot different:
The basic concept behind our bot is 'modularity'. Modularity means the degree to which parts can be interchanged and replaced easily
>We used breadboard instead of fretboard to mount the esp32 and the motor driver
>We had a separate detachable sensor module 
>We had two detachable cardboard rectangles that helped in the AUV mechanical statement  to climb the ball up
>Soldering was done only for the motor wires and the sensors on the fretboard, thus reducing power consumption and waste

Another innovation that was made during the project was the parabolic reflector sensor module
This module contains one HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a parabolic plane reflector, a hyperbolic plane reflector; arranged in a Cassegrain telescope configuration as seen in the figure




Bot Components:
motors: 100 rpm
tyres: treads along with rubberbands increase friction
