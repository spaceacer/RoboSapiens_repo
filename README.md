What makes our Bot different:
  The basic concept behind our bot is 'modularity'. Modularity means the degree to which parts can be interchanged and replaced easily
  We used breadboard instead of fretboard to mount the esp32 and the motor driver
  We had a separate detachable sensor module 
  We had two detachable cardboard rectangles that helped in the AUV mechanical statement  to climb the ball up
  Soldering was done only for the motor wires and the sensors on the fretboard, thus reducing power consumption and waste

Another innovation that was made during the project was the parabolic reflector sensor module
This module contains one HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a parabolic plane reflector, a hyperbolic plane reflector; arranged in a Cassegrain telescope configuration as seen in the figure

Bot components:
  White metal chassis
  4 motors (100 rpm) along with nuts to fit
  4 wheels
  1 L298N motor driver
  1 breadboard (medium sized)
  esp32
  connecting wires (MM,MF,FF)
  2 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
  Soldering kit
  wire cutter
  nuts and bolts (that fit metal chassis holes)

Procedure:
assemble the bot according to the image
